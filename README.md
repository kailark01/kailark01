# Kai — Vibe Coding Enjoyer

### 👋 Yo, I'm **Kai** (aka **kailark01**)

Just a chill person who vibes with code, even if I'm not a hardcore programmer.
I mostly mess around, try stuff, break stuff, fix stuff… then break it again.

### 🧪 What I Do (Vibe Edition)

* 🌐 Know a bit of **HTML**, enough to make cool pages
* 🐧 Customize my **Linux distro** until it breaks
* 💻 Learn random tech things at 3AM
* 📦 Collect and enjoy **free-to-use open-source code**
* 🔧 Tweak configs just because it’s fun

### 📂 My Repos (When I Actually Make Some)

For now it’s empty.
But soon? Maybe:

* ✨ cool HTML pages
* 🔧 scripts I yoinked then modified
* 🐧 Linux configs
* 💬 random experiments
